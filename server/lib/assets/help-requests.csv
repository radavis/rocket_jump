Blackjack ,"My blackjack game is riddled with bugs. My approach was to design black jack using OO principles. I created a game class and was able to run the game smoothly. The only downside being there was no dealer behavior within the program. Initially, I thought that I should create a player class but hoped I could find a lazier way. My solution was to create a dealer_turn method and call that on my game object. I changed to the other class methods to take arguments for both the player's and the dealer's hand.

Ruby exercise: guess the number game,"I have been able to write a program that works in most cases (where the user inputs an integer, it always works), but there are some cases where the program incorrectly interprets invalid input as a valid input, specifically when invalid input begins with a number (e.g. the program interprets '12abc' as an integer). ","I have tried searching on Stack Overflow for how to tell whether something is an integer or a string, but none of the solutions I found applied to my program.","I tried to create my own solution for how to interpret invalid input, but I think that something with the way that I wrote it is not working properly. Here's what I wrote to interpret whether the user input an invalid response: 

guess = gets.chomp
if (guess + 1.to_s).to_i < 1
puts 'Invalid input'

The reason why I've written this is because a problem I came up against is that when you use .to_i on a string that cannot be directly converted into an integer, Ruby converts it to 0. I wanted a way to differentiate between a user inputting '0' and 'abc'. If they enter '0' and you add the string '0' to the string '1', the result is '01'. If you convert that back to an integer, you get 1. If they enter 'abc' and you add the string 'abc' to '1', the result is 'abc1.' If you convert that to an integer, you get 0. This line of code will then know that if they have entered an invalid input (something that cannot be converted directly to an integer), it will satisfy the criteria of the resulting integer being less than 1 and they receive the error message. If they enter 0, it goes into the next set of if statements about whether their input is greater than or less than the correct response. 

I'm guessing the reason why Ruby interprets an input of '12abc' as being a valid input is because if you run the input of '12abc' through this piece of code, you get '12abc1'. Ruby keeps the 12 as 12, and sees the rest of the string as 0, so it interprets '12abc'.to_i as 12. I can't figure out how to write something where an invalid input like '12abc' is always interpreted correctly.

The goal of this exercise is to figure out what the maximum expenditure was per state. (Jason's direction). The first hash (expenditures) contains a list of states (the keys) and then every cost that state incurred. Each state key has one value which is an array of numbers. The second hash (max_per_state) contains the same list of states, but each value is the number zero. What I want to do is compare the two hashes and where the key in the expenditures hash matches the key in the max_per_state hash, compare the values. If the value in the expenditure hash is bigger than the max_per_state value (again, for the same key), replace the value. Keep iterating until the maximum value has been established. 

I've been at this for a few hours and can't figure out how to crack this nut. I googled comparing hashes but didn't find anything that seemed similar.

"has_many, through, through?","So I've got a question about my BT data model.

I've got 4 tables all related to each other. Meetup, Location, neighborhood and a meetup_location join table. 

As it stands now:
-A meetup_loc record belongs to both a location and a meetup.
-A meetup has a meetup_loc and a location through meetup.
-A location has many meetup_locs and has many meetups through meetup_loc
-A location also belongs to a neighborhood.
-A neighborhood has many locations.

From a neighborhood, I can access a singular Meetup record through using something like this:

neighborhood.locations.first.meetup_locs.first.meetup.

But this doesn't seem like the best way to do it and I'd really like to be able to do neighborhood.meetups and get an array of meetups. Is there a way to do this without going and adding another has_many/belongs_to association? Or are having multiple paths of ownership kosher?",N/A,N/A

I cant seem to sum them for the life of me. I have tried many addition methods and must be missing something trivial. I have ran .class and .inspect and can confirm that is is an array of float/integers (because I control that assignment in the code above)

Selecting Multiple Options from a Join Table,"I have a quick question concerning join tables and multiple selections on a form.

I have two models in a Rails App (4.0), one is called Skills, and the other, Opportunity. An opportunity can have many skills associated with it, and a skill can be associated with many opportunities.

Because of that type of relationship I created a join table called Opportunity_Skills. This table just has skill_id, and opportunity_id.

Here are my associations written out:

class Skill < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :opportunity_skills
  has_many :opportunities, through: :opportunity_skills
end


class Opportunity < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :opportunity_skills
  has_many :skills, through: :opportunity_skills

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :opportunity_skills
end


class OpportunitySkill < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :opportunity
  belongs_to :skill
end
I have created an opportunity 'new' page in order for users to create new opportunities. I would like users to be able to select multiple skills while creating a new opportunity. In order to make that happen I have made the Opportunity model accepted nested attributes for opportunity skills.

I can't figure out what I need on my form (using simple form) to make all of the different options show up as check boxes (the values in the skills table). Any ideas or suggestions would be great. If I left out any information and/or just plain didn't make sense please let me know and I can provide more details.

Thank you for the help in advance.

Splitting an array-like object of class File,"https://gist.github.com/avallabh/fa024ec95e779ff8d1dc

I am fetching a user's tweets, storing each one in an array, then writing that array to a .txt file","Dash, EEs, all of google, several fellow launchers","(Note: This is a self project. It's neither core nor non-core.)

The tweet output looks like an array, but I think it's a File object because I'm passing the entire array into File, and I can't call #split on it (NoMethodError). I wrote the output to a CSV file as well and the data is formatted the same way as a text file. Jason mentioned Readline (I think he meant the class and not the method.), but neither the class nor method looks to be what I need.

The gist has a sample of what I want my code to be for now - an array of arrays is fine. In the future, I'll make it an array of hashes or hash of hashes (like rottentomatoes).

Old Roman Numerals Chris Pine problem and Chapter concepts questions,I would like an explanation regarding the old roman numerals problem and some of the concepts that were used to solve it.,I tried to figure this out on my own and rechecked the chapter but I need clarification. There's no way around it.,"I have a number of questions regarding this chapter. I understood the logic using integer and modulo division but the book solved it far more simply than what I was trying to do. I'll post my questions and illustrate what I think is going on. I'll start with the Roman numeral question:

def old_roman_numeral(num)

  roman = ''
  
  roman = roman + ""M"" * (num / 1000)
  
  roman = roman + ""D"" * (num % 1000 / 500)
  
  roman = roman + ""C"" * (num % 500 / 100)
  
  roman = roman + ""L"" * (num % 100 / 50)
  
  roman = roman + ""X"" * (num % 50 / 10)
  
  roman = roman + ""V"" * (num % 10 / 5)
  
  roman = roman + ""I"" * (num % 5 / 1)
  
  roman
  
end
  
old_roman_numeral(443)

Questions:

1. What does the roman = ''  do? Why is this needed? Is this the same as assigning a blank array?
2. Why do we need the roman before the end of the method? I've commented this out and it works just fine. 
3. Why are the local variables not changing? Because they are labeled the same, each subsequent roman variable should be different from the last one. I was going to try to concatenate the different variables at the end for the answer.

This sample function I made changes the local variable

def function(n)
  
  number = 1
  
  number = number + n
  
  number = number + n
  
  number
  
end

puts function(1)

4. What does roman before then end do? I commented it out and the method still works without it. Is it returning the roman variables?



Chapter concept questions:

1. When I run programs on the terminal, I've never had the prompt return or puts ""nil"". It does this on codecademy labs but not on the terminal iTerm.
2. For the say_moo ""yellow submarine"" example"" the code doesn't work on the terminal or on codecademy labs. 

def say_moo(number_of_moos)

  puts 'mooooooo....' * number_of_moos

  'Yellow submarine'
  
end

x = say_moo(3)

puts. x.capitalize + ', dude..'

puts x + '.'

(eval):88: undefined method `x' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)

If someone could answer these questions for me it would be much appreciated thanks.

Setting Default Text Editor in Pry or Shell,"Want to use pry command ""edit file_name.rb"" to launch the sublime text window. I researched change default editor (now using nano) and didn't understand how to execute command.

Setting the default editor

As an alternative to invoking an editor through the shell you can also set a default editor for Pry.

The Pry.config.editor variable defaults to the environment variable $EDITOR (or nano if $EDITOR is not defined). If you set it to a String then that string is used as the shell command to invoke the editor. If you set it to a callable (e.g a Proc) then file and line are passed in as parameters and the return value of that callable invocation is used as the exact shell command to invoke the editor.

The value of Pry.config.editor is then used by commands such as edit.

Note that it maybe be convenient to set your desired editor in the .pryrc file or else in the $EDITOR environment variable.

Example: Setting a String

Pry.config.editor = ""emacsclient""",https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki/Editor-integration#wiki-Set_editor,I think the string name is the path or just file name for where my sublime application is.

Rendering has_many objects,"* Please note this is regarding the non-core part of the challenge. I had no problem with the core part.
* You can see my repo: https://github.com/cg5544/dog_network 

I was able to associate owner and dog models by using simple_form's ""simple_field_for' when owner makes a registration. The one thing that's really weird is in ""show.html.erb' page, when I call ""owner.dogs"", the dog objects appeared on the webpage like this: #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy::ActiveRecord_Associations_CollectionProxy_Dog:0x007ffe56112e50>

So it looks like during registration, a dog gets created and associated with owner when registration is complete, but rendering the dog object by doing ""owner.dogs"" doesn't print out the actual dog name, instead it prints out dog objects memory address. Not sure why that is. ",Everything and anything that talks about nested resources/models,"I am not sure to be honest. I tried few other things, such as owner.dogs.pluck(:name) but that doesn't return anything aside from empty array.

Syntax question from reading,I want to know why there is a syntax difference between a reading assignment and the actual code in the reading.

<%= form_for [@post, @comment] do |f| %>

    <%= f.label :body, 'Comment' %><br />
    <%= f.text_field :body %>
  </div>
  <div class=""actions"">
    <%= f.submit %>
  </div>
<% end %>
<%= render ""menu_items/form"", menu_item: @menu_item %>

*At the top it has instance variables in an array. The code for the assignment is show below:

<%= form_for(menu_item) do |f| %>
  <% if @menu_item.errors.any? %>
    <div id=""error_explanation"">
      <h2><%= pluralize(@menu_item.errors.count, ""error"") %> prohibited this event from being saved:</h2>

      <ul>
      <% @menu_item.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>
        <li><%= msg %></li>
      <% end %>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <% end %>

    <%= f.label :name %><br />

  </div>
  <div class=""actions"">
    <%= f.submit %>

There is no instance variable for the above code but a local variable. Is this because its a rendered object? Would I nee to create a new rendered form for comments, or is there a way to place comments in this rendered form already?

2) 4.1.2.4 :dependent

If you set the :dependent option to :destroy, then deleting this object will call the destroy method on the associated object to delete that object. If you set the :dependent option to :delete, then deleting this object will delete the associated object without calling its destroy method. If you set the :dependent option to :restrict, then attempting to delete this object will result in a ActiveRecord::DeleteRestrictionError if there are any associated objects.

Controls what happens to the associated object when its owner is destroyed:

:destroy causes the associated object to also be destroyed
:delete causes the associated object to be deleted directly from the database (so callbacks will not execute)
:nullify causes the foreign key to be set to NULL. Callbacks are not executed.
:restrict_with_exception causes an exception to be raised if there is an associated record
:restrict_with_error causes an error to be added to the owner if there is an associated object"

Nested resources,"I have many questions about nested routes, specifically on the controller. 

The nested routes are
resources :categories do
    resources :ads
end

In AdsController, I defined ""new"" and ""create"" actions like this:

def new
    @category = Category.find(params[:category_id])
    @ad = Ad.new
  end

  def create
    @category = Category.find(params[:category_id])
    @ad = @category.ads.build(ad_params)

    if @ad.save
      redirect_to new_category_ad_path, notice: ""Your ad is posted. Good luck!""
    else
      render 'new'
    end

  end

  private
  def ad_params
    params.require(:ad).permit(:title, :detail, :contact, :category_id, :city_id).merge(user_id: current_user.id)
  end

I don't think this is correct because ad isn't getting created when I ran the test. 
Secondly I also have question about the way I wrote the strong params. I feel like it's NOT secure to list category_id and city_id in there because anyone can hack them by using different values. So I am not sure what is the best way to handle this. 

Lastly in my new.htm.erb page for creating a new ad:

<%= simple_form_for [@category, @ad] do |f| %>
  <%= f.association :category, label_method: :name, value_method: :id, include_blank: true, required: true %>
  <%= f.association :city, label_method: :name, value_method: :id, include_blank: true, required: true%>
  <%= f.input :title, required: true %>
  <%= f.input :detail, required: true %>
  <%= f.input :contact, label: ""Best Way to Contact Me"" %>
  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>

My question is if it's correct to pass in [@category, @ad]? And since a new ad belongs to a category AND city, am I using the association on this form correctly?

The second method takes the user input and compares it to a variable that randomly generates a number between 1 and 1000 when a user runs the program (rand(a..b) method).

It works fine for any other string (ie. I can print ""dog"" after every new line, but I can't print ""\n"") Puts also doesn't work. ","The Ruby documentation, stack exchange, talked about it some with Nick.",I think there's some limit I'm not understanding on how you're supposed to use newline? Or there's some error in the test/how I'm implementing my function.

The array of hashes allows me to sort by :wins but it doesn't have a method for checking for repeats. IS there a method that can solve the repeats/sorting problem or should I use an entirely different data structure?
